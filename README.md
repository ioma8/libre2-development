# libre2-development
This repository is intended for the general exchange of technical details of FreeStyle Libre 2 and to advance reverse engineering practices. Since the Libre 2 cannot currently be read by systems other than the associated reading device, everyone is warmly invited to start developing it with the information collected (whether privately or here is up to each person).
